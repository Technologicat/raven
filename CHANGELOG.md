# Changelog

**0.2.4** (October 2025, in progress):

**Changed**:

- *Raven-visualizer*:
  - Configurable plotter colors (background, grid, colormap). Loaded from `raven.visualizer.config` at app startup.
  - Configurable word cloud colors (background, colormap). Loaded from `raven.visualizer.config` at app startup.
  - The section headings in the BibTeX import dialog are now clickable, and perform the same function as the icon buttons.
  - *Visualizer*'s importer now automatically uses *Raven-server* for embeddings and NLP if it is running.
    - If the server is not running, the AI models are loaded locally (in the client process) as before.
    - There is no visible difference from the user's perspective (other than saving some VRAM, if also *Librarian* is running at the same time).

- *Raven-librarian*:
  - The document database now uses *Raven-server* for embeddings and NLP.
    - This saves some VRAM, by avoiding loading another copy of the same models in the client process.
    - This also makes the `raven.librarian.hybridir` information retrieval backend fully client-server, allowing the AI components for this too to run on another machine.
    - Because *Librarian* requires *Raven-server* for other purposes, too, *Librarian* will not start if the server is not running.
  - Many small UI improvements, for example:
    - Window resizing implemented.
    - Collapsible thinking traces.
    - Interrupt/continue.
    - Help card added.

- Tools:
  - *Raven-pdf2bib*: Overhauled. See updated instructions in [visualizer README](raven/visualizer/README.md).


**Fixed**:

- *Raven-visualizer*:
  - Fix bug: "reset zoom" missed some datapoints (in a "select visible", hotkey F9), if they were exactly at the edges of the data bounding box.
    - Note that also loading a dataset resets the zoom, so the bug also affected the initial view upon loading a dataset.
    - Workaround for previous versions: after a "reset zoom", zoom out by one mouse wheel click before using "select visible".
  - Fix bug: wrong dtype in the embedder loader's CPU fallback.
    - The CPU fallback loader now always uses float32.
    - Workaround for previous versions: when working without a GPU, configure the embedder explicitly to use dtype `torch.float32`. See `raven.visualizer.config` and `raven.server.config`.
  - Fix UI bug: the plotter axes no longer light up when the mouse hovers on them.
    - The axes are not clickable, so the highlight was spurious.
    - This was broken when we upgraded to DearPyGUI 2.0, where the plotter changed to introduce that hover-highlight by default. Now we disable the highlight by theming the plotter.

- *Raven-avatar*:
  - Fix bug: Also the background image is now hidden while the avatar is paused.

**0.2.3** (7 October 2025):

**Added**:

- Prototype of *Raven-librarian*, a scientific LLM frontend GUI app.
  - Features an animated AI avatar with TTS and auto-translated subtitles, document database (plain text files for now), and tool-calling support (websearch for now).
    - Document database uses hybrid search (BM25 for keyword search, ChromaDB for semantic search).
  - In this prototype, chats are saved, but going back to previous chats is not yet possible because the GUI for that has not yet been developed.
  - When the *Documents* checkbox in the GUI is ON, the document database is autosearched, using the user's latest message to the AI as the query.
    - If, additionally, the *Speculation* checkbox is OFF, the LLM is bypassed when there is no match in the document database.
  - Websearch is enabled when the *Tools* checkbox in the GUI is ON.
  - Requires both *Raven-server* and the LLM backend (oobabooga/text-generation-webui, with `--api`) to be running.
  - For configuring Raven-librarian, for now, see `raven.librarian.config`.
    - The default location for the document database is `~/.config/raven/llmclient/documents`.
      - Librarian monitors this directory automatically, and also scans for offline changes at app startup.
      - Put `.txt` files there; they are search-indexed automatically. Replace files; the index is updated automatically. Remove files; they are removed from the index automatically.
      - If you need to force a manual index rebuild: make sure Librarian is not running, then delete `~/.config/raven/llmclient/rag_index`. It will be rebuilt at app startup.

- *Raven-avatar* now has a "data eyes" effect, for use as an LLM tool access indicator in Librarian.
  - Cel animation, up to 4 frames. Can be tested in `raven-avatar-settings-editor`.

- Speech video recording in `raven-avatar-settings-editor`.
  - Output goes in the `rec/` subdirectory.
  - TTS speech is saved as `.mp3` files, one per sentence.
  - Avatar video (avatar only, no background) is saved as as individual frames as `.qoi`.
    - For converting the video frames into a usable format, see the `raven-qoi2png` tool.
  - A speech timings list is saved as `.txt`.
  - These can be used to piece together a speech video in a video editor such as *OpenShot*.


**Changed**:

- *Raven-visualizer*'s importer now uses both the title and the abstract to cluster the inputs.
  - This requires *Snowflake-Arctic* or better as the embedding model; the older *mpnet* model tends to lead everything to become one cluster if the abstracts are used for clustering.
  - Old datasets must be imported again for the changes to take effect, because the embeddings are computed at import time.
    - Old embeddings caches must be deleted before re-importing!
    - For example, when `mydata.bib` is imported, Raven's importer produces:
      - `mydata_embeddings_cache.npz`: The vector embeddings. Delete this cache file!
      - `mydata_nlp_cache.pickle`: The natural language processing results, used for keyword detection. This cache is not affected by this change, so no need to delete.

- *Raven-server* now hosts all AI components, including embeddings and spaCy NLP.
  - spaCy NLP is only available for Python-based clients running the same versions of Python and spaCy, because it communicates in spaCy's internal format.

**0.2.2** (13 August 2025):

**Added**:

- First complete tech demo of *Raven-avatar*.
  - See the GUI apps `raven-avatar-settings-editor` (completely new postprocessor settings GUI) and `raven-avatar-pose-editor` (ported from the old THA3 pose editor).
  - The settings editor requires *Raven-server* to be running.

- *Raven-avatar* now has cel-blending and animefx support.


---

**0.2.1** (18 June 2025):

Otherwise the same as 0.2.0 (17 June 2025), but with the TODO cleaned up. Documenting both here.

**Added**:

- *Raven-server*: to provide an animated AI avatar, and to eventually host all AI components.
  - This is a web API server, initially ported and stripped from the discontinued *SillyTavern-extras*.
    - AGPL license! Affects the `raven.server` and `raven.avatar.pose_editor` directories.
    - All other components of *Raven* remain BSD-licensed. This includes `raven.avatar.settings_editor`.
  - Pose editor ported from wxPython to DPG, to match the rest of the *Raven* constellation, and to require only one GUI toolkit.
  - Added in d42d52356d61d290d4d9a1e5ffd0e1b6e0843c61, 22 May 2025. The entrypoint has since moved to `raven.server.app`.
  - Avatar has new features compared to the old Talkinghead:
    - Lipsync, to new TTS module based on Kokoro-82M.
    - Anime4k upscaling (super-resolution).
