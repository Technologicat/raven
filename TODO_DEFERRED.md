## AMD GPU (ROCm) support audit

ROCm presents as `"cuda"` in PyTorch, so our Lanczos kernel and `deviceinfo` validation should already work on AMD GPUs. However, the rest of the codebase needs auditing:

- All custom Torch code (postprocessor filters, Anime4K upscaler, avatar renderer) — likely fine, but verify.
- Third-party ML libraries: `transformers`, `sentence-transformers`, Flair, Whisper, Kokoro TTS — check ROCm compatibility status for each.
- THA3 (vendored) — uses standard `nn.Module`, probably fine.

Discovered while implementing `raven/common/lanczos.py`.
