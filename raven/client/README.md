# Raven-client

The *Raven-client* component is not a standalone app, but rather, a toolkit for building your own Python apps that use *Raven-server*.

The documentation of *Raven-client* is at the [Python bindings section of the *Raven-server* manual](../server/README.md#python-bindings-easy-client-api).
