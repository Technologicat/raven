    # All of these effects are optional. Effects are rendered in the order listed below. The ordering matters only if an emotion has multiple effects assigned to it.
    #
    # - When animefx are enabled, all characters use generic fx cels ("fx_*.png") by default, so that the effects can be enabled for any character without extra effort.
    #
    # - If you want to customize the look of the effects for a specific character, supply those cels for that character ("mycharacter_fx_*.png").
    #   Character-specific cels automatically override the generic ones.
    #
    # - To disable a specific animefx for all characters, but keep its settings, use its "enabled" setting.
    #
    # - To disable all animefx for all characters, use the "animefx_enabled" setting below.
