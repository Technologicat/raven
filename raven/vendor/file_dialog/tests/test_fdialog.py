"""Tests for `FileDialog`'s file type filter and Find field.

Two layers. `_normalize_filter` is a module-level pure function needing no DPG context — which is why it
was hoisted out of the constructor's closure. The rest drives a real dialog against a real directory,
because what the filter *means* only shows up in which rows survive into `shown_items`.

No window is ever mapped, so nothing here takes keyboard focus and none of it carries the `gui` marker.

The Find field's matching rule is not re-tested here: it is `raven.common.utils.make_search_matcher`,
shared with Visualizer's search and the xdot widget's, and tested with those. What *is* tested here is
that the dialog routes the Find field through it.
